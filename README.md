### Used the supabase storage to store the cat pics!

Motivation
---
After following supabase and seeing my twitter feed flooding with people doing their best to build
anything and everything with supabase got me super motivated to learn some javascript and frontend.
So I have built this simple webpage with vanilla js using supabase storage to host the supacat pics.
